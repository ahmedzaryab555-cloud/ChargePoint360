# ChargePoint360
A cloud-based system for finding EV charging stations is called ChargePoint360. The project uses an interactive online map hosted on the Microsoft Azure Cloud to assist EV drivers in locating charging stations in their area. For EV users in UAE, this system guarantees dependability, scalability, and accessibility.  It's for my ICT171  assignment.
